    <h1>Our Love Story</h1>
    <p>Happy Two Months of Talking Raina! The love of my life deserves the world and more and this is just a small token of my appreciation. I promise that I will make you feel like the most loved girl in the world. Even through the ups and downs of our relationship, you have always been committed to be with me. I really really love you so so much and the amount of words that I say to show my love don't even compare to how much I love you my baby!</p>

          <h3>The First Facetime </h3>
          <p>The first moment I felt a connection with you! A random day where you told me to play Shawarma game on Roblox and we played together for so long. We finally capped off the night with the signature 67, the special thing between us.</p>

          <p>Laughing, opening up, and losing track of time together. Whether it is on text or on facetime, no matter what we are talking about I love every second of it. Most of the time... Especially, when I ask you my dumb questions at like 1 am, and how we both fall asleep watching shows.</p>

          <h3>Our Roblox Tradition</h3>
          <p>Playing Roblox with you is one of the special things in our relationship. I love playing the game no matter what it is even though we sometimes get frustrated a lot. But, I love working together with you, laughing with you, being scared with you it is a perfect experience. And, now we have grown to play other games like Zombs (we gotta get a win), Clash (pleaseeee can we play), and Fornite (hopefully)</p>

          <h3>Ups and Downs </h3>
          <p>Raina I know we have had a LOT of ups and some downs, but I honestly think that makes us such a strong couple and gives me confidence that we will work because we are able to compromise and fix our problems. Especially recently I know we have had rlly rlly high highs and downs with like arguments and sadness, but looking back I don't really see it as a problem. I feel like it made us stronger every time and now I can trust you completely and your advice and support are some of many reasons why I love you.</p>

You are able to talk to me about something that you are passionate about whether it is clothes, makeup, or caring about your friends, and it makes me feel special that this is only for me. Not to mention the fact that you look beautiful and so pretty every single time like GOD DAMN.</p>
